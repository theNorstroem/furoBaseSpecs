    google.protobuf.Struct #`Struct` represents a structured data value, consisting of fields
     which map to dynamically typed values. In some languages, `Struct`
     might be supported by a native representation. For example, in
     scripting languages like JS a struct is represented as an
     object. The details of that representation are described together
     with the proto support for the language.

     The JSON representation for `Struct` is JSON object.
  fields:
    fields: 'map<string,google.protobuf.Value>:1 #Unordered map of dynamically typed values.'
