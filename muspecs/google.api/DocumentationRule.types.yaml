  fields:
    selector: |-
        string:1 #The selector is a comma-separated list of patterns. Each pattern is a
         qualified name of the element which may end in "*", indicating a wildcard.
         Wildcards are only allowed at the end and for a whole component of the
         qualified name, i.e. "foo.*" is ok, but not "foo.b*" or "foo.*.bar". A
         wildcard will match one or more components. To specify a default for all
         applicable elements, the whole pattern "*" is used.
    description: 'string:2 #Description of the selected API(s).'
    deprecation_description: |-
        string:3 #Deprecation description of the selected element(s). It can be provided if
         an element is marked as `deprecated`.
