    google.api.ProjectProperties #A descriptor for defining project properties for a service. One service may
     have many consumer projects, and the service may want to behave differently
     depending on some properties on the project. For example, a project may be
     associated with a school, or a business, or a government agency, a business
     type property on the project may affect how a service responds to the client.
     This descriptor defines which properties are allowed to be set on a project.

     Example:

        project_properties:
          properties:
          - name: NO_WATERMARK

            description: Allows usage of the API without watermarks.
          - name: EXTENDED_TILE_CACHE_PERIOD
