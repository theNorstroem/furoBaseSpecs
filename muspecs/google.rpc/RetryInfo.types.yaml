    google.rpc.RetryInfo #Describes when the clients can retry a failed request. Clients could ignore
     the recommendation here or retry when this information is missing from error
     responses.

     It's always recommended that clients should use exponential backoff when
     retrying.

     Clients should wait until `retry_delay` amount of time has passed since
     receiving the error response before retrying.  If retrying requests also
     fail, clients should use an exponential backoff scheme to gradually increase
     the delay between retries based on `retry_delay`, until either a maximum
     number of retries have been reached or a maximum retry delay cap has been
     reached.
  fields:
    retry_delay: 'google.protobuf.Duration:1 #Clients should wait at least this long between retrying the same request.'
